This project demonstrates the implementation of basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on an embedded system using a Arduino UNO. The system takes user inputs through buttons or a keypad, processes the arithmetic operations, and displays the results on an LCD screen or via serial communication. It is a simple and efficient demonstration of how embedded systems can perform essential mathematical tasks while interfacing with hardware peripherals.
